						I love how it’s integrated with streaming platforms. I’m a very busy dad who also works 50+ hours a week so when I have the energy to stream that’s what I do. I rarely have time for anything else like clips but with the service of Eklipse that takes all the extra time I need out of the equation.

						This tool has saved me soo much time and made some pretty great clips! The closed captions are also SUPER easy to do and better than Capcut in my opinion. I also used the Pro edits and man! Great price for good quality editing!

						It's a very good website for content creators to get clips for their social medias, it really helps new content creators to try to get popular and get people to follow them or watch them live.

						Great clips but sometimes it’s to short, they give you the option to make it longer. Less time downloading and editing. More time to spend with the wife. Would recommend 👍🏼

						The company is pretty on top of things in terms of troubleshooting any issues, updating the service, and providing quality of life updates. The clips aren't always perfect but the quality is good and the service stands to get clips when I miss them myself. It saves me time that I already don't have. I appreciate that being a dad.
